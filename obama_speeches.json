        "text": "President Obama: (00:00)\nAh, hello, Richmond. It is good to be back in Virginia. Although I have to say that unlike some other states, I\u2019m in Virginia all the time, because it\u2019s pretty close by to where I live. It is good to see you on this beautiful day. I am so grateful to the Young Democrats at VCU for hosting us today. It\u2019s good to see some young idealism at work, young activists getting out and doing the work. I could not be prouder of you. It\u2019s thanks to extraordinary young people like you that I was able to get elected to the US Senate. You helped deliver Virginia twice for me. I\u2019ll always love you for it. You delivered for Terry McAuliffe, and now I\u2019m asking you to do it one more time by electing Terry the next governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\nPresident Obama: (01:23)\nIn fact, I love you too. I do. Over the years, actually, you guys have come through for a lot of great leaders, many of whom are here today. Your outstanding governor, Ralph Northam, your next lieutenant governor, Hala Ayala, your current and future attorney general, Mark Herring. My dear friend, first person outside Illinois to endorse me for president of the United States, your great senator, Tim Kaine. Congressman Donald McEachin is here. Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, Eileen Filler-Corn. The great mayor of Richmond, Levar Stoney.\n\nPresident Obama: (02:28)\nThese are leaders that you\u2019ve come through for multiple times. And in 10 days, you\u2019ve got a chance to do it again. You\u2019ve got a chance to elect Terry and Hala and Mark and to keep Virginia moving forward. And before we start anything else, I want to remind you and everybody who\u2019s watching: You don\u2019t have to wait until November 2nd to cast your ballot. You can vote early right now, either by mail or in person. If you don\u2019t\u2026 Don\u2019t be [inaudible 00:03:14]. Don\u2019t be sitting on the couch saying, \u201cI\u2019ll get to it later.\u201d You can out early right now. If you\u2019ve got a ballot at home, you can return it by mail, or you can hand it in at your local registrar\u2019s office, or you can take it to a drop- off location today.\n\nPresident Obama: (03:31)\nDon\u2019t leave it on your desk. If you\u2019re like me, your desk is cluttered. You end up spilling stuff. You\u2019re like, \u201cOh man, I got to start all over again, get another ballot.\u201d Do it now. You\u2019ll feel good. You\u2019ll feel good about exercising the franchise. Or, you can vote early in person today. Just go to iwillvote.com/va to make your plans. Millions of Virginians voted early last year. Let\u2019s do it again this year. Don\u2019t wait. You agree, don\u2019t you? Yes, you do. All right. Now that we\u2019ve got that very important piece of business out of the way, let me tell you a little bit about Terry and why I know he will be a fantastic governor again. First thing to know about Terry is, as you just witnessed, he\u2019s very persuasive. Let me tell you, if I told Michelle I wanted to run for the same office after a few years away, she would\u2019ve said something I cannot repeat. The rough translation would\u2019ve been \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama: (04:58)\nNow, I don\u2019t know the conversation that Terry had with Dorothy, but Dorothy, thank you, because I could not be happier that Terry is back on the ticket. He\u2019s persuasive. And the reason I couldn\u2019t be happier is because I know he will make you proud as governor, because he\u2019s already done it. He did it the last time. There are times where you don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s face it, when you elected Barack Obama, you were like, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Maybe you knew, but I have to say, I look at some of that old footage, I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, he looks really young. I can\u2019t believe they trusted him to do all that stuff. He looks like he\u2019s 25 years old.\u201d That was before the gray hair. Some of you who are very young don\u2019t remember, but I used to have black hair.\n\nPresident Obama: (05:54)\nBut with Terry, you know. He\u2019s done it. And you know this about Terry: He knows how to work hard. This guy is the Energizer bunny. He does not sleep. He does not stop. He started his own business at the age of 14, paving driveways to help pay for college. Now, I don\u2019t remember exactly what I was doing at 14, but I will tell you, I was not starting my own business. And ever since, Terry has brought the same grit and determination to everything he\u2019s done, from public service, to business, to being a husband, to being a father of five amazing children.\n\nPresident Obama: (06:43)\nSo the guy knows how to work hard, and he\u2019s persuasive, and Terry knows what it means to lead. A lot of times, you see candidates say one thing to one group of people, and then they act a little bit different with another group of people. They don\u2019t seem sincere. They don\u2019t want you to know what they\u2019re really all about. But with Terry, you don\u2019t have to wonder what he\u2019s going to be like as governor, because you\u2019ve seen it. He walked the walk, didn\u2019t just talk the talk. As your governor, Terry kept Virginia on the right track after the great recession. He helped create 200,000 jobs, drove unemployment down in every city and county in Virginia, not just in the sections of Northern Virginia that were getting tech jobs, et cetera. Every county, every city in Virginia, he was working to make sure the people got opportunity, every single one.\n\nPresident Obama: (07:47)\nSo when Terry tells you he\u2019s going to help Virginia rebuild a stronger economy that creates good jobs, when he says that he\u2019s going to invest in education and workers, when he says he\u2019s going to help families from every everywhere get ahead, South and North, you can believe it, because he\u2019s done it before. And that kind of experience matters, because the work we need to do is too important to just leave to chance. This pandemic has made the last couple years incredibly hard for a lot of Virginians. But thanks to leaders like Governor Northam and President Biden, we\u2019ve been making progress. The national unemployment rate is the lowest it\u2019s been since the pandemic started. In Virginia, it\u2019s even lower. Schools have reopened. Jobs are coming back. Businesses are starting to recover. We\u2019re moving forward. Now we\u2019ve got a choice. We can go backwards, we can plunge right back into the misguided policies and the divisiveness and the negligence that made this pandemic so much worse than it ever had to be-\n\nPresident Obama: (09:02)\n\u2026 Pandemic so much worse than it ever had to be. Or, we can build an economy that works for everybody, not just the few. Where kids have a shot at a great education, and workers can get the skills they need for good new jobs. Where we follow the science when it comes to the pandemic. Where we work together, and we listen to each other, and we move this country forward. That\u2019s what Terry\u2019s running on. That\u2019s why he wants to be your Governor. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve got to get out there and vote. To make Virginia a magnet for good jobs. To make sure our kids can go to school safely.\n\nPresident Obama: (09:40)\nTerry talked about it. He\u2019s got a plan to boost the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024. Help give young people like the ones in this audience the education they deserve. Make healthcare more affordable for everybody. We\u2019ve got half a million Virginia\u2019s getting help on the Affordable Care Act. We can be doing more, and Terry is going to do it. He talked about protecting a woman\u2019s right to make her own healthcare decisions. To keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. And Terry talked about wanting to work in a bi-partisan way with reasonable Republicans. He\u2019s not just saying that for the campaign. He did it when he was Governor. He\u2019s walked the walk. And by the way, Terry is not alone. All across the country, Democrats are working to make sure that the wealthiest Americans, and largest corporations pay their fair share in taxes so we can do things like make childcare more affordable, so we can make real progress in the fight against climate change.\n\nPresident Obama: (10:59)\nAll across the country, Democrats are trying to make it easier to vote, not make it harder to vote, and push back on Republicans who are trying to systematically prevent ordinary citizens from making their voices heard. Just this past week, some of you probably saw, every Democrat in the Senate supported a bill that would protect the right to vote, and ban partisan gerrymandering, and reduce the influence of dark money in our politics. Every Democrat voted for it, every Republican voted against it. Which by the way, there\u2019s a little bit of an [inaudible 00:11:35], but you have to ask yourself, why is it Republicans don\u2019t want you to vote? What is it that they\u2019re afraid of? I would assume, Terry, if they think they\u2019ve got better ideas, why don\u2019t they just go make the case?\n\nPresident Obama: (11:55)\nTell us your ideas. Tell us why you think they\u2019re going to be better. Tell us how it\u2019s going to help that man get a job, or help that young person go to college, or help that person get a trade. Just explain it. And if you\u2019ve got good ideas, people will flock to your ideas, but that\u2019s not what they try to do. Instead, you\u2019re trying to rig elections. Because the truth is people disagree with your ideas. And when that doesn\u2019t work, you start fabricating lies, and conspiracy theories about the last election. The one you didn\u2019t win. That\u2019s not how democracy is supposed to work.\n\nPresident Obama: (12:40)\nOur democracy is what makes America great. It\u2019s what makes us the shining city on the hill. This extraordinary experiment in self-government, and protecting that, and preserving that, that shouldn\u2019t be a partisan issue. It didn\u2019t use to be. That\u2019s what Terry, and Democrats everywhere are focused on. Let\u2019s shift for a moment to what Terry\u2019s opponent is running on. Don\u2019t boo. Vote. Booing doesn\u2019t do nothing. Booing might make you feel better, but it\u2019s not going to get Terry elected. Vote. Don\u2019t boo. I want you to get fired up inside and then go vote. Terry\u2019s opponent, he\u2019s thinking Virginia\u2019s either aren\u2019t paying attention, or he thinks that they\u2019re gullible. This is someone who has been very successful, made hundreds of millions of dollars, and you know what, that\u2019s great. We don\u2019t begrudge success. We want everyone in America to have a chance to pursue their dreams.\n\nPresident Obama: (14:06)\nThat\u2019s what Terry did as a successful business person himself. But you notice that having achieved success, Terry then decided I need to give back. I need to lift people up. I need to create more ladders of opportunity for everybody else. Because somebody did that for me, I\u2019m going to do it for the next group of people coming along. That\u2019s why he got into public service. His opponent, ah, not so much. His opponent doesn\u2019t want people like him to pay a dime more in taxes to support education, or job training, or childcare, or all the other things that might help the next generation get ahead.\n\nPresident Obama: (14:58)\nAlthough now, suddenly he wants you to believe that he\u2019s discovered the middle-class. Terry\u2019s opponent, he supported a policy that would cut education and public safety, and put more than 40,000 teaching jobs at risk right here in Virginia. And now he\u2019s telling you, he\u2019s very concerned about our kids, and our streets. He told some voters in private that he can\u2019t talk about a woman\u2019s right to choose while he\u2019s running. But he said that if he wins, he\u2019ll restrict the right across Virginia. Don\u2019t boo. How could he claim to be the candidate for women? I don\u2019t either. As far as I can tell the big message of Terry\u2019s opponent is that he\u2019s a regular guy because he wears fleece, and he\u2019s accusing schools of brainwashing our kids. He\u2019s also said he wanted to audit the voting machines used in the last Presidential election again. Really? Encouraging the lies and conspiracy theories that we\u2019ve had to live through all this time. And yet we\u2019re supposed to believe he\u2019s going to stand up for our democracy? Listen, I want to emphasize this. I\u2019m glad that the guy can play basketball. Many of you know, I\u2019m a big hooper, that\u2019s a good thing. The guy can hoop. That\u2019s great. I\u2019m less convinced that the co CEO of one largest private equity firms in the world spends his time washing dishes and going grocery shopping, but who knows? Maybe. But, you do notice that whenever a wealthy person runs for office, they always want to show you what a regular guy they are. But that\u2019s okay. But when your supporters hold a rally where they pledge allegiance to a flag that was flown at the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th, the biggest threat to our democracy in my lifetime. When you don\u2019t separate yourselves from them, when you don\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem, well, you know what? That\u2019s a problem. You can\u2019t run ads telling me you\u2019re a regular old hoops playing, dish washing, fleece wearing guy\u2026\n\nPresident Obama: (18:02)\n\u2026 old hoops-playing, dishwashing, fleece-wearing, guy, but quietly cultivate support from those who seek to tear down our democracy. Either he actually believes in the same conspiracy theories that resulted in a mob, or he doesn\u2019t believe it, but he\u2019s willing to go along with it to say, or do anything to get elected. And maybe that\u2019s worse, because that says something about character. And character will end up showing when you actually are in office. What are you willing to stand up for? When are you willing to say no to your own supporters? When are you willing to say there\u2019s some things that are more important than getting elected and maybe American democracy is one of those things.\n\nPresident Obama: (19:15)\nVirginia, we\u2019ve got too much to get done, to be dealing with the okey doke. Here we are trying to recover from a global pandemic that has killed more than 700,000 Americans, that shut down thousands of small businesses and put millions out of work. We don\u2019t have time to be wasting on these phony, trumped-up culture wars, this fake outrage that right wing media\u2019s pedals to juice their ratings. And the fact that he\u2019s willing to go along with it, instead of talking about serious problems that actually affect serious people. That\u2019s a shame. That\u2019s not what this election\u2019s about. That\u2019s not out what you need, Virginia.\n\nPresident Obama: (20:06)\nInstead of forcing our communities to cut back at a time when we\u2019re just starting to recover, we should be doing more to support people who are educating our kids and keeping our neighborhoods safe. Instead of spreading misinformation and disinformation about the last election, we should be trying to strengthen our democracy and make it easier for more people to vote in future elections. Instead of stoking anger, aimed at school boards and administrators who are just trying to keep our kids safe, who are just doing their jobs. So get angered to the point where some of them are actually getting death threats. We should be making it easier for teachers and schools to give our kids the world class education they deserve and to do so safely while they\u2019re in the classroom.\n\nPresident Obama: (21:13)\nSo we\u2019re at a turning point right now, both here in America and around the world, because there\u2019s a mood out there. We see it. There\u2019s a politics of meanness and division and conflict, of tribalism and cynicism. And that\u2019s one path. But the good news is there\u2019s another path, where we pull together and we solve big problems and we rebuild our society in a way that gives more and more people, a better life. And that\u2019s the choice we face. It\u2019s a choice I believe will define not just the next few years, but the next few decades of human history. Maybe longer than that.\n\nPresident Obama: (22:09)\nI look out at some of these young people who were two, when I was elected, not born yet. You were born. Thank you. I\u2019m glad you were at least born. He\u2019s only a few months old, but he was born.\n\nPresident Obama: (22:36)\nBut I look at them because I see in these young people, I see my own daughters. And I think about the world we\u2019re giving to them. The thing about being a parent is that you hear it\u2019s a cliche and then it happens. And two of those cliches are true. One cliche is that boy, they grow up fast. But the other cliche is you will do anything, anything to make sure their lives are better. You will sacrifice anything for them.\n\nPresident Obama: (23:19)\nAnd so right now, we\u2019re helping to determine what kind of democracy are they going to inherit, what kind of planet they\u2019re going to inherit, What kind of economy we\u2019re going to inherit. What are we leaving for them? And it\u2019s our choice. And I\u2019m here today because I believe Virginia will make the right choice. I believe America ultimately will make the right choice. I believe you right in Virginia are going to show the rest of the country and the world that we\u2019re not going to indulge in our worst instincts. We\u2019re not going to go back to the chaos that did so much damage. We\u2019re going to move forward with people like Terry leading the way.\n\nPresident Obama: (24:18)\nAnd here\u2019s the thing. In order for that to happen, we need your help. We need you to vote. Look, I know a lot of people are tired of politics right now. Listen, I\u2019ll make a confession. I never watch political shows. Michelle and I, when we\u2019re at home, I\u2019m reading, she\u2019s watching HGTV, maybe the Food Channel. So I understand why people might be tired of politics and the arguments and the tweets and the back and the fourth. And some of you\u2019re just plain tired, because this has been hard. I understand why people are frustrated. We thought that the pandemic was just about done and then suddenly the Delta comes up and it kind of throws us for a loop and people are just tired. They feel cooped up. They\u2019re not sure what\u2019s safe. All this arguments going on, on TV all the time, folks wearing masks. Look, I believe that wearing masks is the right thing to do for people that we care about.\n\nPresident Obama: (25:38)\nWe do it for people who are vulnerable, not just for ourselves. But let\u2019s face it. I mean, I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge, sometimes I lose my mask. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, man, where is it?\u201d You I mean, I understand why people just feel kind of like, \u201cOh, when\u2019s this going to end?\u201d And sometimes politics in Washington feels that way. Right? It\u2019s like, oh, are we still arguing about gay marriage? Really? I thought that ship had sailed. I thought that was pretty clearly the right thing to do. We got Republicans across the country who said, of course. And that we\u2019re going to reopen that can up. What? So I understand why sometimes folks get tired. But here\u2019s the thing. We can\u2019t afford to be tired, because of these young people right here, and the young people that are coming. And it\u2019s hard. Terry doesn\u2019t claim that by being governor suddenly every problem is going to be solved. I didn\u2019t solve every \u2026\n\nPresident Obama: (27:03)\nI didn\u2019t solve every problem when I was President. I mean, the fact is that it\u2019s hard to undo the legacy of discrimination that goes back centuries. It\u2019s hard to deal with special interests who want to keep the status quo when you\u2019re trying to make the economy more fair and more just. It\u2019s hard in a big country like this, where people disagree a lot, to get everybody moving in the same direction. But here\u2019s the thing. We can make it better.\n\nPresident Obama: (27:37)\nWhen you got the right person in the job, we might not get every single person to get a job, but more people will get jobs. We may not get every child the best education in the world, but we can get a lot more kids a better education. I didn\u2019t get everybody healthcare in America, but we got a whole lot more people healthcare in America. It makes a difference when we decide to make things better.\n\nPresident Obama: (28:09)\nAnd when you\u2019ve got somebody in your corner who has shown that they will work for you, who has a track record of accomplishment, then you\u2019ve got to go out there and work for him, not because everything\u2019s suddenly going to be perfect, but because it\u2019s going to be better. When you got somebody like Terry, who\u2019s responsible and serious, he\u2019s worth fighting for. So you got to go out there and show the cynics that you\u2019re willing to knock on doors for Terry, to make the calls for Terry, to tell your friends and neighbors what\u2019s at stake.\n\nPresident Obama: (28:53)\nWe ain\u2019t got time to be tired. We don\u2019t have time to be tired. What is required is sustained effort. I was thinking about it, because I haven\u2019t campaigned for a while, I, I went back to my first campaign and I remember in my first Presidential election, I spoke in Grant Park about a woman, 106 years old, who had voted for me, African American, Miss Cooper, 106. And I tried to imagine everything that she had gone through in her life. Born in the shadow of slavery, deep in the midst of Jim Crow, a time where women, when she was born, didn\u2019t have the right to vote, much less black folks. And yet she described how she, the minute she had a chance to vote, had never missed, including up to the time where the first African American nominee of a major party had the chance to become President of the United States. She had witnessed all that.\n\nPresident Obama: (30:18)\nAnd I thought, \u201cNow, if she\u2019s not tired, I can\u2019t be tired.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama: (30:28)\nIf John Lewis wasn\u2019t tired, we can\u2019t be tired. If the folks who had to fight for union rights across the country weren\u2019t tired, we sure can\u2019t be tired. If the suffragists weren\u2019t tired, we can\u2019t be tired.\n\nPresident Obama: (30:49)\nSo go out there and fight and work because you\u2019re going to decide this election and the direction of Virginia and the direction of this country for generations to come. Don\u2019t sit this one out. And make sure you vote for Democrats up and down the ballot, including for state legislature, where a lot of important work actually gets done. I used to be a state legislator. Don\u2019t forget them because there\u2019s what\u2019s going to help Terry be able to deliver for you. And if you do these things, if you\u2019re not tired, if you work, if you vote up and down the ballot, if you get your friends and neighbors and your cousins to vote, if you do all that, we will elect Terry McAuliffe. We will elect Hala Ayala. We will elect Mark Herring. We\u2019ll build on our majorities in the state legislature. We\u2019ll keep Virginia on the path to a better future. I have faith in you. Have faith in yourselves. Get out there, get to work. Yes, we can. God bless you, Virginia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarack Obama: (02:05)\nGood evening everybody. As you\u2019ve seen by now this isn\u2019t a normal convention. It\u2019s not a normal time. So tonight I want to talk as plainly as I can about the stakes in this election. Because what we do, these next 76 days, will echo through generations to come. I\u2019m in Philadelphia, where our Constitution was drafted and signed. It wasn\u2019t a perfect document. It allowed for the inhumanity of slavery and failed to guarantee women and even men who didn\u2019t own property the right to participate in the political process. But embedded in this document was a north star that would guide future generations. A system of representative government, a democracy, to which we could better realize our highest ideals. Through civil war and bitter struggles, we improved this constitution to include the voices of those who\u2019d once been left out, and gradually we made this country more just and more equal and more free.\n\nBarack Obama: (03:26)\nThe one constitutional office elected by all of the people is the presidency. So at a minimum, we should expect a president to feel a sense of responsibility for the safety and welfare of all 330 million of us, regardless of what we look like, how we worship, who we love, how much money we have, or who we voted for, but we should also expect a president to be the custodian of this democracy. We should expect that regardless of ego, ambition or political beliefs, the president will preserve, protect and defend the freedoms and ideals that so many Americans marched for, went to jail for, fought for and died for. I have sat in the Oval Office with both of the men who are running for president. I never expected that my successor would embrace my vision or continue my policies. I did hope for the sake of our country that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously. That he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care. But he never did.\n\nBarack Obama: (04:56)\nFor close to four years now, he has shown no interest in putting in the work. No interest in finding common ground, no interest in using the awesome power of his office to help anyone but himself and his friends. No interest in treating the presidency as anything but one more reality show that he can use to get the attention he craves. Donald Trump hasn\u2019t grown into the job because he can\u2019t, and the consequences of that failure are severe. 170,000 Americans dead. Millions of jobs, gone, while those at the top taking more than ever. Our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before.\n\nBarack Obama: (05:58)\nNow I know that in times as polarized as these, most of you have already made up your mind, but maybe you\u2019re still not sure which candidate you\u2019ll vote for or whether you\u2019ll vote at all. Maybe you\u2019re tired of the direction we\u2019re headed but you can\u2019t see a better path yet, or you just don\u2019t know enough about the person who wants to lead us there. So let me tell you about my friend, Joe Biden. 12 years ago when I began my search for a vice president, I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d end up finding a brother. Joe and I come from different places, different generations but what I quickly came to admire about Joe Biden is his resilience borne of too much struggle, his empathy, borne of too much grief.\n\nBarack Obama: (06:57)\nJoe is a man who learned early on to treat every person he meets with respect and dignity, living by the words his parents taught him, \u201cNo one\u2019s better than you Joe, but you\u2019re better than nobody.\u201d That empathy, that decency, the belief that everybody counts, that\u2019s who Joe is. When he talks with someone who\u2019s lost her job, Joe remembers the knight his father sat him down to say that he\u2019d lost his. When Joe listens to a parent who is trying to hold it all together right now, he does it as a single dad who took the train back to Wilmington each and every night so he could tuck his kids into bed. When he meets with military families who\u2019ve lost their hero, he does it as a kindred spirit, the parent of an American soldier. Somebody whose faith has endured the hardest loss there is.\n\nBarack Obama: (08:07)\nFor eight years Joe was the last one in the room whenever I faced a big decision. He made me a better president and he\u2019s got the character and the experience to make us a better country and in my friend, Kamala Harris, he\u2019s chosen an ideal partner, who is more than prepared for the job. Someone who knows what it\u2019s like to overcome barriers and who\u2019s made a career fighting to help others live out their own American dream.\n\nBarack Obama: (08:39)\nAlong with the experience needed to get things done, Joe and Kamala have concrete policies that will turn their vision of a better, fairer, stronger country into reality. They will get this pandemic under control, like Joe did when he helped me manage H1N1 and prevent an Ebola outbreak from reaching our shores. They\u2019ll expand healthcare to more Americans like Joe and I did 10 years ago, when he helped craft the Affordable Care Act and nail down the votes to make it the law. They\u2019ll rescue the economy, like Joe helped me do after the Great Recession. I asked him to manage the Recovery Act which jump-started the longest stretch of job growth in history, and he sees this moment now not as a chance to get back to where we were but to make long overdue changes so that our economy actually makes life a little easier for everybody, whether it\u2019s a waitress trying to raise a kid on her own, or the shift worker, always on the edge of getting laid off, or the student, figuring out how to pay for next semester\u2019s classes.\n\nBarack Obama: (09:51)\nJoe and Kamala will restore our standing in the world and as we\u2019ve learned from this pandemic, that matters. Joe knows the world and the world knows him. He knows that our true strength comes from setting an example that the world wants to follow. A nation that stands with democracy, not dictators. A nation that can inspire and mobilize others to overcome threats like climate change and terrorism, poverty and disease. But more than anything, what I know about Joe, what I know about Kamala, is that they actually care about every American and that they care deeply about this democracy.\n\nBarack Obama: (10:47)\nThey believe that in a democracy, the right to vote is sacred and we should be making it easier for people to cast their ballots, not harder. They believe that no one, including the president, is above the law, and that no public official, including the president, should use their office to enrich themselves or their supporters. They understand that in this democracy, the commander in chief does not use the men and women of our military who are willing to risk everything to protect our nation as political props to deploy against peaceful protesters on our own soil. They understand that political opponents aren\u2019t un-American just because they disagree with you. A free press isn\u2019t the enemy, but the way we hold officials accountable. That our ability to work together to solve big problems like a pandemic depend on a fidelity to facts and science and logic and not just making stuff up.\n\nBarack Obama: (12:02)\nNone of this should be controversial. These shouldn\u2019t be Republican principles or Democratic principles, they are American principles, but at this moment, this president and those who enable him have shown they don\u2019t believe in these things. Tonight I am asking you to believe in Joe and Kamala\u2019s ability to lead this country out of these dark times and build it back better. But here\u2019s the thing. No single American can fix this country alone. Not even a president. Democracy was never meant to be transactional, you give me your vote, I make everything better. It requires an active and informed citizenry. So I\u2019m also asking you to believe in your own ability, to embrace your own responsibility as citizens. To make sure that the basic tenants of our democracy endure. Because that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake right now. Our democracy.\n\nBarack Obama: (13:16)\nLook, I understand why a lot of Americans are down on government. The way the rules have been set up and abused in Congress make it easier for special interests to stop progress than to make progress. Believe me, I know it. I understand why a white factory who\u2019s seen his wages cut or his job shipped overseas might feel like the government no longer looks out for him and why a black mom might feel like it never looked out for her at all. I understand why a new immigrant might look around this country and wonder whether there\u2019s still a place for him here. Why a young person might look at politics right now, the circus of it all, the meanness and the lies, and conspiracy theories and think, \u201cWhat is the point?\u201d Well here\u2019s the point. This president and those in power, those who benefit from keeping things the way they are, they are counting on your cynicism. They know they can\u2019t win you over with their policies, so they\u2019re hoping to make it as hard as possible for you to vote and to convince you that your vote does not matter. That is how they win. That is how they get to keep making decisions that affect your life and the lives of the people you love. That\u2019s how the economy will keep getting skewed to the wealthy and well-connected. How our health systems will let more people fall through the cracks.\n\nBarack Obama: (15:00)\nThat\u2019s how a democracy withers until it\u2019s no democracy at all and we cannot let that happen. Do not let them take away your power. Do not let them take away your democracy. Make a plan right now for how you are going to get involved and vote. Do it as early as you can and tell your family and friends how they can vote too. Do what Americans have done for over two centuries when faced with even tougher times than this. All those quiet heroes who found the courage to keep marching, keep pushing in the face of hardship and injustice.\n\nBarack Obama: (15:50)\nLast month, we lost a giant of American democracy in John Lewis and some years ago I sat down with John and a few remaining leaders of the early Civil Rights Movement. One of them told me he never imagined he\u2019d walk into the White House and see a president who looked like his grandson, and then he told me that he had looked it up, and it turned out that on the very day that I was born, he was marching into a jail cell, trying to end Jim Crow segregation in the South. What we do echoes through generations. Whatever our backgrounds, we are all the children of Americans who fought the good fight. Great grandparents who were working in fire traps and sweatshops without rights or representation. Farmers losing their dreams to dust. Irish and Italians and Asians and Latinos told, \u201cGo back to where you come from.\u201d Jews and Catholics, Muslims and Sikhs, made to feel suspect for the way they worshiped. Black Americans chained and whipped and hanged, spit on for trying to sit at lunch counters. Beaten for trying to vote.\n\nBarack Obama: (17:30)\nIf anyone had a right to believe that this democracy did not work and could not work, it was those Americans. Our ancestors. They were on the receiving end of a democracy that had fallen short all their lives. They knew how far the daily reality of America strayed from the [inaudible 00:17:54], and yet instead of giving up, they joined together and they said, \u201cSomehow, some way, we are going to make this work. We are going to bring those words in our founding documents to life.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama: (18:19)\nI have seen that same spirit rising these past few years. Folks of every age and background who packed city centers and airports and rural roads so that families wouldn\u2019t be separated, so that another classroom wouldn\u2019t get shot up, so that our kids won\u2019t grow up on an uninhabitable planet. Americans of all races joining together to declare, in the face of injustice and brutality at the hands of the state, that black lives matter. No more, but no less, so that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism. To the young people who led us this summer, telling us we need to be better, in so many ways, you are this country\u2019s dreams fulfilled. Earlier generations had to be persuaded that everyone has equal worth. For you it\u2019s a given, a conviction, and what I want you to know is that for all its messiness and frustrations, your system of self-government can be harnessed to help you realize those convictions for all of us. You can give our democracy new meaning. You can take it to a better place. You\u2019re the missing ingredient, the ones who will decide whether or not America becomes the country that fully lives up to its creed.\n\nBarack Obama: (20:19)\nThat work will continue long after this election, but any chance of success depends entirely on the outcome of this election. This administration has shown it will tear our democracy down if that\u2019s what it takes for them to win. So we have to get busy building it up by pouring all our efforts into these 76 days and by voting like never before for Joe and Kamala and candidates up and down the ticket so that we leave no doubt about what this country that we love stands for today, and for all our days to come. Stay safe. God bless.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarack Obama: (00:01)\nI\u2019m honored to be with you once again, as we pay our respects as Americans to those who gave their lives for us all.\n\nBarack Obama: (00:14)\nHere at Arlington, the deafening sounds of combat have given way to the silence of these sacred hills. The chaos and confusion of battle has yielded to perfect precise rows of peace. The Americans who rest here and their families, the best of us, those from whom we asked everything, ask of us today only one thing in return, that we remember them. If you look closely at the white markers that grace of these hills, one thing you\u2019ll notice is that so many of the years, dates of birth and dates of death, are so close together. They belong to young Americans. Those who never lived to be honored as veterans for their service, men who battled their own brothers in civil war, those who fought as a band of brothers an ocean away, men and women who redefined heroism for a new generation. They are generals buried beside privates they led, American\u2019s known as Dad or Mom, some only known to God.\n\nBarack Obama: (01:47)\nMr. Hallinan, a Marine who then watched over these grounds, has said, everyone here is someone\u2019s hero. Those who rest beneath this silence, not only here at Arlington, but at veterans\u2019 cemeteries across our country and around the world, and all who still remained missing, they didn\u2019t speak the loudest about their patriotism. They let their actions do that. Whether they stood up in times of war, signed up in times of peace or were called up by a draft board, they embodied the best of America.\n\nBarack Obama: (02:32)\nAs commander in chief, I have no greater responsibility than leading our men and women in uniform. I have no more solemn obligation than sending them into harm\u2019s way. I think about this every time I approve an operation as president, every time as a husband and father that I assign a condolence letter, every time Michelle and I sit at the bedside of a wounded warrior or grieve and hug members of a Gold Star family. Less than 1% of our nation wears the uniform. And so few Americans see this patriotism with their own eyes or know someone who exemplifies it. But every day there are American families who pray for the sound of a familiar voice when the phone rings, or the sound of a loved one\u2019s letter or email arriving. More than one million times in our history, it didn\u2019t come. And instead a car pulled up to the house and there was a knock on the front door and the sound of taps floated through a cemetery\u2019s trees.\n\nBarack Obama: (03:53)\nFor us, the living, those of us who still have a voice, it is our responsibility, our obligation to fill that silence with our love and our support and our gratitude. And not just with words, but with our actions. For truly remembering and truly honoring these fallen Americans means being there for their parents and their spouses and their children, like the boys and girls here today wearing red shirts and bearing photos of the fallen. Your moms and dads would be so proud of you, and we are too. Truly remembering means that after our fallen heroes gave everything to get their battle buddies home, we have to make sure our veterans get everything that they have earned from good healthcare to a good job. And we have to do better. Our work is never done. We have to be there not only when we need them, but when they need us.\n\nBarack Obama: (04:55)\n30 days before he would be laid to rest a short walk from here, President Kennedy told us that a nation reveals itself not only by the people that produces, but by those it remembers. Not everyone will serve. Not everyone will visit this national sanctuary. But we remember our best in every corner of our country from which they came. We remember them by teaching our children at schools with fallen heroes, names like Dorie Miller Elementary in San Antonio, or being good neighbors in communities named after great generals like McPherson, Kansas, or when we walk down 1st Sergeant Bobby Mendez Way in Brooklyn, or drive across the Hoover Dam on a bridge that bears Pat Tillman\u2019s name.\n\nBarack Obama: (05:45)\nWe reveal ourselves in our words and deeds, but also by the simple act of listening. My fellow Americans, today and every day, listen to the stories these Gold Star families and veterans have to tell. Ask about who he or she was, why they volunteered. Here from those who love them about what their smile looked like and their laugh sounded like, and the dreams they had for their lives. Since we gathered here one year ago, more than 20 brave Americans have given their lives for the security of our people in Afghanistan. And we pray for them all and for their families. In Iraq in our fight against ISIL, three Americans have given their lives in combat on our behalf. And today, I ask you to remember their stories as well.\n\nBarack Obama: (06:50)\nCharles Keating IV, Charlie, Chuck or C4 was born into a family of veterans, all American athletes and Olympians, even a gold medalist. So naturally, Charlie and the love of his life, Brooke celebrated their anniversary on the 4th of July. She called them the huge goofball everybody wanted to be friends with. The adventurer who surfed and spearfished and planned to sail around the world. When the Twin Towers fell he was in high school and he decided to enlist. Joined the SEALS because he told his friends it was the hardest thing to do. He deployed to Afghanistan and three times to Iraq, earning a Bronze Star for Valor.\n\nBarack Obama: (07:36)\nAnd earlier this month, while assisting local forces in Iraq would come under attack, he gave his life. A few days later, one of his platoon mates sent Charlie\u2019s parents a letter from Iraq. \u201cPlease tell everyone Chuck saved a lot of lives today.\u201d, it said. \u201cHe left us with that big signature smile on his handsome face as always. Chuck was full of Aloha, but was also a ferocious warrior.\u201d So today we honor Chief Special Warfare Officer Charles Keating IV.\n\nBarack Obama: (08:12)\nLouis Cardin was the sixth of seven children, a Californian with an infectious wit who always had a joke at the ready to help someone get through a tough time. When his siblings ran around the house as kids, his mom Pat would yell after them, \u201cWatch that baby\u2019s safety margin.\u201d Today, she realizes that what she was really doing was raising a Marine. As a teenager, he proudly signed up. Louis graduated high school on a Friday, three days later on Monday morning, the Marines came to pick him up. That was 10 years ago. One morning this March, a marine knocked on his mother\u2019s door again.\n\nBarack Obama: (08:54)\nOn his fifth tour at a fire base in Iraq, Louis gave his life while protecting the Marines under his command. Putting others before himself was what Louis did best. He chose to live in the barracks with his buddies, even when he could have taken a house off base. He volunteered to babysit for friends who needed a date night. He just earned a promotion to mentor his fellow Marines. When they brought Louis home, hundreds of strangers lined freeway overpasses and the streets of Southern California to salute him. And today we salute staff Sergeant Louis Cardin.\n\nBarack Obama: (09:34)\nJoshua Wheeler\u2019s sister says he was exactly what was right about this world. He came from nothing and he really made something of himself. As a kid, Josh was the one who made sure his brother and four half sisters were dressed and fed and off to school. When there wasn\u2019t food in the cupboard, he grabbed his hunting rifle and came back with a deer for dinner. When his country needed him, he enlisted in the Army at age 19. He deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan 14 times, earned 11 Bronze Stars, for for Valor. Last October, as ISIL terrorist prepared to execute 70 hostages, Josh and his fellow special ops went in and rescued them. Every single one walked free. \u201cWe were already dead.\u201d, one of the hostages said. \u201cThen God sent us a force from the sky.\u201d That force was the US Army, including Joshua Wheeler.\n\nBarack Obama: (11:01)\nJosh was the doting dad who wrote notes to his kids in the stacks of books he read. Flying home last summer to be with his wife Ashley, who was about to give birth, he scribbled one note in the novel he was reading just to tell his unborn son he was on his way. Ashley Wheeler is with us here today, holding their 10 month old son, David. Ashley says Josh\u2019s memory makes her think about how can she be a better citizen. And she hopes it\u2019s what other people think about too. Today, this husband and father rests here in Arlington in Section 60. And as Americans, we resolve to be better, better people, better citizens because of Master Sergeant Joshua Wheeler.\n\nBarack Obama: (12:28)\nA nation reveals not only by the people that produces, but by those it remembers. We do so not just by hoisting a flag, but by lifting up our neighbors. Not just by pausing in silence, but by practicing in our own lives the ideals of opportunity and liberty and equality that they fought for. We can serve others and contribute to the causes they believed in. And above all, keep their stories alive so that one day when he grows up and thinks of his dad, an American like David Wheeler can tell them as well the stories of the lives that others gave for all of us. We are so proud of them. We are so grateful for their sacrifice. We are so thankful to those families of the fallen. May God bless our fallen and their families. May he bless all of you and may he forever bless these United States of America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarack Obama: (00:00)\nTo Joe Solmonese, who is doing an outstanding job on behalf of HRC. To my great friend and supporter, Terry Bean co-founder of HRC. Representative Patrick Kennedy, David Hebner the Ambassador Designee to New Zealand and Samoa. John Berry, our Director of OPM, who is doing a great job. Nancy Sutley, Chairman of Council on Environmental Quality, Fred Hochberg Chairman of Export Import Bank. And my dear friend, Tipper Gore, who\u2019s in the house. Thank you so much, all of you. It is a privilege to be here tonight to open for Lady Gaga.\n\nBarack Obama: (01:38)\nI\u2019ve made it. I want to thank the Human Rights Campaign for inviting me to speak and for the work you do every day in pursuit of equality on behalf of the millions of people in this country who work hard in their jobs and care deeply about their families and who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. For nearly 30 years, you\u2019ve advocated on behalf of those without a voice, and that\u2019s not easy. For despite the real gains that we\u2019ve made, there\u2019s still laws to change and there\u2019s still hearts to open. There are still fellow citizens, perhaps neighbors, even loved ones, good and decent people who hold fast to outworn arguments and old attitudes, who fail to see your families like their families, who would deny you the rights most Americans take for granted, and that\u2019s painful and it\u2019s heartbreaking.\n\nBarack Obama: (02:58)\nAnd yet, you continue leading by the force of the arguments you make and by the power of the example that you set in your own lives as parents and friends, as PTA members and church members, as advocates and leaders in your communities, and you\u2019re making a difference. That\u2019s the story of the movement for fairness and equality, and not just for those who are gay, but for all those in our history who\u2019ve been denied the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.\n\nBarack Obama: (03:37)\nFor all who\u2019ve been told that the full blessings and opportunities of this country were closed to them. It\u2019s the story of progress sought by those with little influence or power, by men and women who brought about change through quiet, personal acts of compassion and defiance, wherever and whenever they could. It\u2019s the story of the Stonewall protests, when a group of citizens with a few options\u2026 When a group of citizens with few options and fewer supporters stood up against discrimination and helped to inspire a movement. It\u2019s the story of an epidemic that decimated a community and the gay men and women who came to support one another and save one another, who continue to fight this scourge, who have demonstrated before the world that different kinds of families can show the same compassion in a time of need.\n\nBarack Obama: (04:34)\nAnd it\u2019s the story of the Human Rights Campaign and the fights you fought for nearly 30 years, helping to elect candidates who share your values, standing against those who would enshrine discrimination into our constitution, advocating on behalf of those living with HIV AIDS, and fighting for progress in our Capitol and across America. This story, this fight continues now and I\u2019m here with a simple message. I\u2019m here with you in that fight.\n\nBarack Obama: (05:05)\nFor even as we face extraordinary challenges as a nation, we cannot and we will not put aside issues of basic equality. I greatly appreciate the support I\u2019ve received from many in this room. I also appreciate that\u2026 I also appreciate the many of you don\u2019t believe progress has come fast enough. I want to be honest about that because it\u2019s important to be honest among friends. Now, I\u2019ve said this before, I\u2019ll repeat it again, it\u2019s not for me to tell you to be patient, any more than it was for others to counsel patience to African-Americans petitioning for equal rights half a century ago. But I will say this, we have made progress and we will make more, and I think it\u2019s important to remember that there is not a single issue that my administration deals with on a daily basis that does not touch on the lives of the LGBT community.\n\nBarack Obama: (06:50)\nWe all have a stake in reviving this economy. We all have a stake in putting people back to work. We all have a stake in improving our schools and achieving quality, affordable healthcare. We all have a stake in meeting the difficult challenges we face in Iraq and Afghanistan. For while some may wish to define you solely by your sexual orientation or gender identity alone, you know and I know that none of us wants to be defined by just one part of what makes us whole. You\u2019re also\u2026\n\nBarack Obama: (07:27)\nYou\u2019re also parents worried about your children\u2019s futures. You\u2019re spouses who fear that you or the person that you love will lose a job. You\u2019re worker\u2019s worried about the rising cost of health insurance. You\u2019re soldiers, you are neighbors, you are friends, and most importantly, you are Americans who care deeply about this country and its future.\n\nBarack Obama: (08:03)\nSo I know you want me working on jobs, and the economy, and all the other issues that we\u2019re dealing with, but my commitment to you is unwavering even as we wrestle with these enormous problems. And while progress may be taking longer than you\u2019d like as a result of all that we face, and that\u2019s the truth, do not doubt the direction we are headed and the destination we will reach.\n\nBarack Obama: (08:35)\nMy expectation is that when you look back on these years you will see a time in which we put a stop to discrimination against gays and lesbians, whether in the office or on the battlefield. You\u2019ll see a time in which we as a nation finally recognize relationships between two men or two women as just as real and admirable as relationships between a man and a woman.\n\nBarack Obama: (09:02)\nYou will see a nation that\u2019s valuing and cherishing these families as we build a more perfect union, a union in which gay Americans are an important part. I am committed to these goals and my administration will continue fighting to achieve them. Now there\u2019s no more poignant or painful reminder of how important it is that we do so then the loss experienced by Dennis and Judy Shepard, whose son Matthew was stolen in a terrible act of violence 11 years ago.\n\nBarack Obama: (10:06)\nIn May, I met with Judy, who\u2019s here tonight with her husband. I met her in the Oval Office and I promised her that we were going to pass an inclusive hate crimes bill, a bill named for her son. This struggle has been long. Time and again, we faced opposition. Time and again, the measure was defeated or delayed, but the Shepards never gave up. They turned tragedy into an unshakeable commitment, countless activists and organizers never gave up. You held vigils. You spoke out year after year, Congress after Congress, the House passed the bill again this week, and I can announce that after more than a decade, this bill is set to pass, and I will sign it into law.\n\nBarack Obama: (11:23)\nIt\u2019s a testament. It\u2019s a testament to the decade long struggle of Judy and Dennis, who tonight will receive a tribute named for somebody who inspired so many of us. Named for Senator Ted Kennedy, who fought tirelessly for this legislation. And it\u2019s a testament to the Human Rights Campaign and those who organized and advocated. And it\u2019s a testament to Matthew and others who\u2019ve been victims of attacks, not just meant to break bones, but to break spirits, not meant just to inflict harm, but instill fear. Together we will have moved closer to that day when no one has to be afraid to be gay in America.\n\nBarack Obama: (12:08)\nWhere no one has to fear walking down the street holding the hand of the person they love, but we know that there\u2019s far more work to do. We\u2019re pushing hard to pass an inclusive employee non-discrimination bill.\n\nBarack Obama: (12:36)\nFor the first time ever an administration official testified in Congress in favor of this law. Nobody in America should be fired because they\u2019re gay despite doing a great job in meeting their responsibilities. It\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not right. We\u2019re going to put a stop to it.\n\nBarack Obama: (13:00)\nAnd it\u2019s for this reason that if any of my nominees are attacked, not for what they believe, but for who they are, I will not waiver in my support because I will not waiver in my commitment to ending discrimination in all its forms.\n\nBarack Obama: (13:20)\nWe are reinvigorating our response to HIV AIDS, here at home and around the world. We\u2019re working closely with the Congress to renew the Ryan White Program and I look forward to signing it into law in the very near future. We are rescinding the discriminatory ban on entry to the United States based on HIV status.\n\nBarack Obama: (13:53)\nThe regulatory process to enact this important change is already underway. And we also know that HIV AIDS continues to be a public health threat in many communities, including right here in the District of Columbia. Jeffrey Crowley, the Director of the Office of National AIDS Policy, recently held a forum in Washington, D.C., and is holding forums across the country to seek input as we craft a national strategy to address this crisis. We are moving ahead on Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell.\n\nBarack Obama: (14:29)\nWe should not\u2026 We should not be punishing patriotic Americans who have stepped forward to serve this country. We should be celebrating their willingness to show such courage and selflessness on behalf of their fellow citizens, especially when we\u2019re fighting two wars.\n\nBarack Obama: (15:08)\nWe cannot afford\u2026 We cannot afford to cut from our ranks people with the critical skills we need to fight, any more than we can afford for our military\u2019s integrity to force those willing to do so into careers encumbered and compromised by having to live a lie. So I\u2019m working with the Pentagon, its leadership, and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy. Legislation has been introduced in the House to make this happen. I will end Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell, that\u2019s my commitment to you.\n\nBarack Obama: (16:07)\nIt is no secret that issues of great concern to gays and lesbians are ones that raise a great deal of emotion in this country and it\u2019s no secret that progress has been incredibly difficult. We can see that with the time and dedication it took to pass hate crimes legislation. But these issues also go to the heart of who we are as a people. Are we a nation that can transcend old attitudes and worn divides? Can we embrace our differences and look to the hopes and dreams that we share? Will we uphold the ideals on which this nation was founded, that all of us are equal, that all of us deserve the same opportunity to live our lives freely and pursue our chance at happiness? I believe we can. I believe we will. And that is why\u2026\n\nBarack Obama: (16:59)\nThat\u2019s why I support ensuring that committed gay couples have the same rights and responsibilities afforded to any married couple in this country. I believe strongly in stopping laws designed to take rights away and passing laws that extend equal rights to gay couples. I\u2019ve required all agencies in the federal government to extend as many federal benefits as possible to LGBT families as the current law allows. And I\u2019ve called on Congress to repeal the so-called Defense of Marriage Act and the pass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act.\n\nBarack Obama: (18:03)\nAnd we must all\u2026 And we must all stand together against divisive and deceptive efforts to feed people\u2019s lingering fears for political and ideological gain. For the struggle waged by the Human Rights Campaign is about more than any policy we can enshrine into law. It\u2019s about our capacity to love and commit to one another. It\u2019s about whether or not we value as a society that love and commitment. It\u2019s about our common humanity and our willingness to walk in someone else\u2019s shoes. To imagine losing a job, not because of your performance at work, but because of your relationship at home. To imagine worrying about a spouse in the hospital with the added fear of that you\u2019ll have to produce a legal document just to comfort the person you love. To imagine the pain\u2026 To imagine the pain of losing a partner of decades and then discovering that the law treats you like a stranger.\n\nBarack Obama: (19:01)\nIf we are honest with ourselves, we\u2019ll admit that there are too many who do not yet know in their lives or feel in their hearts the urgency of this struggle. And that\u2019s why I continue to speak about the importance of equality for LGBT families and not just in front of gay audiences. That\u2019s why Michelle and I have invited LGBT families to the White House to participate in events like Easter Egg Roll, because we want to send a message. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that you continue to speak out, that you continue to set an example, that you continue to press your leaders, including me, and to make the case all across America.\n\nBarack Obama: (19:44)\nSo tonight I\u2019m hopeful, because of the activism I see in this room, because of the compassion I\u2019ve seen all across America, and because of the progress we have made throughout our history, including the history of the movement for LGBT equality. And soon after the protest that Stonewall 40 years ago, the phone rang in the home of a soft-spoken elementary school teacher named Jeanne Manford. It was 01:00 in the morning and it was the police. Now, her son Morty had been at the Stonewall the night of the raids. Ever since he had felt within him a new sense of purpose, so when the officer told Jeanne that her son had been arrested, which was happening often to gay protestors, she was not entirely caught off guard. And then the officer added one more thing, \u201cAnd you know, he\u2019s homosexual.\u201d Well that police officer sure was surprised when Jeanne responded, \u201cYes, I know. Why are you bothering him?\u201d\n\nBarack Obama: (21:01)\nAnd not long after, Jeanne would be marching side by side with her son through the streets of New York. She carried a sign that stated her support. People cheered, young men and women ran up to her, kissed her, and asked her to talk to their parents, and this gave Jeanne and Morty an idea. And so, after that march on the anniversary of the Stonewall protests, amidst the violence and the vitriol of the difficult time for our nation, Jeanne and her husband Jules, two parents who loved their son deeply, formed a group to support other parents and in turn to support their children as well.\n\nBarack Obama: (21:34)\nAt first meeting Jeanne held, in 1973, about 20 people showed up, but slowly interest grew. Morty\u2019s life tragically was cut short by AIDS, but the cause endured. And today, the organization they founded for parents, families, and friends of lesbians, and gays, has more than 200,000 members and supporters. It\u2019s made a difference for countless families across America.\n\nBarack Obama: (22:07)\nAnd Jeanne would later say, \u201cI considered myself such a traditional person. I didn\u2019t even cross the street against the light, but I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody walk over Morty.\u201d That\u2019s the story of America, of ordinary citizens organizing, agitating, and advocating for change, of hope stronger than hate, of love more powerful than any insult or injury, of Americans fighting to build for themselves and their families a nation in which no one is a second class citizen, in which no one is denied their basic rights, in which all of us are free to live in love as we see fit.\n\nBarack Obama: (22:47)\nAnd tonight, somewhere in America, a young person\u2026\n\nBarack Obama: (23:13)\nTonight, somewhere in America, a young person, let\u2019s say a young man, will struggle to fall asleep wrestling alone with a secret he\u2019s held as long as he can remember. And soon, perhaps, he will decide it\u2019s time to let that secret out. What happens next depends on him, his family, as well as his friends, and his teachers, and his community, but it also depends on us. On the kind of society we engender, the kind of future we build.\n\nBarack Obama: (23:42)\nI believe the future is bright for that young person. For while there will be setbacks and bumps along the road, the truth is that our common ideals are a force far stronger than any division that some might sow. These ideals when voiced by generations of citizens are what made it possible for me to stand here today. These ideals are what made it possible for the people in this room to live freely and openly when for most of history that would have been inconceivable. That\u2019s the promise of America, HRC. That\u2019s the promise we\u2019re called to fulfill day by day, law by law, changing mind by mind. That is the promise we are fulfilling. Thank you for the work you\u2019re doing. God bless you. God bless America.\n\nBarack Obama: (24:22)\nThank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarack Obama: (00:00)\nWe the people, in order to form a more perfect union, 221 years ago, in a hall that still stands across the street, a group of men gathered and with these simple words launched America\u2019s improbable experiment in democracy. Farmers and scholars, statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787. The document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished. It was stained by this nation\u2019s original sin of slavery. A question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least 20 more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations.\n\nBarack Obama: (01:10)\nOf course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our constitution. A constitution that had at its very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law. A constitution that promised its people liberty and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time. And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States. But what would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part through protests and struggles, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience, and always at great risk. To narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time.\n\nBarack Obama: (02:14)\nThis was one of the tasks we set forth at the beginning of this presidential campaign, to continue the long march of those who came before us. A march for a more just, more equal, more free, more caring and more prosperous America. I chose to run for president at this moment in history because I believe deeply that we cannot solve the challenges of our time unless we solve them together, unless we perfect our union by understanding that we may have different stories, but we hold common hopes. That we may not look the same and we may not have come from the same place, but we all want to move in the same direction towards a better future for our children and our grandchildren.\n\nBarack Obama: (03:07)\nThis belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the American people, but it also comes from my own story. I am the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. I was raised with the help of a white grandfather who survived a depression to serve in Patton\u2019s Army during World War II and a white grandmother who worked on a bomber assembly line at Fort Leavenworth while he was overseas. I\u2019ve gone to some of the best schools in America and I have lived in one of the world\u2019s poorest nations. I am married to a Black American who carries within her the blood of slaves and slave owners, an inheritance we pass on to our two precious daughters. I have brothers, sisters, nieces, nephews, uncles and cousins of every race and every hue scattered across three continents, and for as long as I live, I will never forget that in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\n\nBarack Obama: (04:12)\nIt\u2019s a story that hasn\u2019t made me the most conventional of candidates, but it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts. That out of many, we are truly one. Throughout the first year of this campaign, against all predictions to the contrary, we saw how hungry the American people were for this message of unity. Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country. In South Carolina where the Confederate flag still flies, we built a powerful coalition of African-Americans and white Americans.\n\nBarack Obama: (05:04)\nThis is not to say that race has not been an issue in this campaign. At various stages in the campaign, some commentators have deemed me either too black or not black enough. We saw racial tensions bubble to the surface during the week before the South Carolina primary. The press has scoured every single exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well. And yet, it has only been in the last couple of weeks that the discussion of race in this campaign has taken a particularly divisive turn.\n\nBarack Obama: (05:43)\nOn one end of the spectrum, we\u2019ve heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action, that is based solely on the desire of wild and wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap. On the other end, we\u2019ve heard my former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation, and that rightly offend white and black alike. I have already condemned in unequivocal terms the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy and in some cases, pain.\n\nBarack Obama: (06:31)\nFor some, nagging questions remain. Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in the church? Yes. Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely. Just as I\u2019m sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests, or rabbis with which you strongly disagree. But the remarks that have caused this recent firestorm weren\u2019t simply controversial. They weren\u2019t simply a religious leader\u2019s efforts to speak out against perceived injustice. Instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country. A view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America.\n\nBarack Obama: (07:31)\nA view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel, instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam. As such, Reverend Wright\u2019s comments were not only wrong but divisive. Divisive at a time when we need unity. Racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems towards a terrorist threat, a falling economy, a chronic health care crisis and potentially devastating climate change. Problems that are neither black or white or Latino or Asian, but rather problems that confront us all.\n\nBarack Obama: (08:22)\nGiven my background, my politics, and my professed values and ideals, there will no doubt be those for whom my statements of condemnation are not enough. Why associate myself with Reverend Wright in the first place? They may ask. Why not join another church? And I confess that if all that I knew of Reverend Wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television sets and YouTube, if Trinity United Church of Christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators, there is no doubt that I would react in much the same way. But the truth is, that isn\u2019t all that I know of the man. The man I met more than 20 years ago is a man who helped introduce me to my Christian faith. A man who spoke to me about our obligations to love one another, to care for the sick and lift up the poor.\n\nBarack Obama: (09:25)\nHe is a man who served his country as a United States marine and who has studied and lectured at some of the finest universities and seminaries in the country. And who for over 30 years has led a church that serves the community by doing God\u2019s work here on earth by housing the homeless, ministering to the needy, providing day care services and scholarships and prison ministries, and reaching out to those suffering from HIV/AIDS. In my first book, Dreams From My Father, I describe the experience of my first service at Trinity, and it goes as follows. \u201cPeople began to shout, to rise from their seats and clap and cry out, a forceful wind carrying the reverend\u2019s voice up into the rafters. And in that single note, hope I heard something else. At the foot of that cross, inside the thousands of churches across the city, I imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of David and Goliath, Moses and Pharaoh, the Christians in the lion\u2019s den, Ezekiel\u2019s field of dry bones.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama: (10:36)\n\u201cThose stories of survival and freedom and hope became our stories, my story. The blood that spilled was our blood, the tears our tears, until this black church, on this bright day, seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world. Our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal, black and more than black. In chronicling our journey, the stories and songs gave us a meaning to reclaim memories that we didn\u2019t need to feel shame about. Memories that all people might study and cherish, and with which we could start to rebuild.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama: (11:31)\nThat has been my experience at Trinity. Like other predominantly black churches across the country, Trinity embodies the black community in its entirety the doctor and the welfare mom. The model student and the former gang-banger. Like other black churches, Trinity\u2019s services are full of raucous laughter and sometimes bawdy humor. They are full of dancing and clapping and screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear. The church contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and yes, the bitterness and biases that make up the black experience in America.\n\nBarack Obama: (12:24)\nAnd this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with Reverend Wright. As imperfect as he may be, he has been like family to me. He strengthened my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children. Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms, or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect. He contains within him the contradictions the good and the bad of the community that he has served diligently for so many years.\n\nBarack Obama: (13:07)\nI can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can disown my white grandmother. A woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed her by on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe. These people are a part of me. And they are part of America, this country that I love. Now some will see this as an attempt to justify or excuse comments that are simply inexcusable. I can assure you it is not. I suppose the politically safe thing to do would be to move on from this episode and just hope that it fades into the woodwork. We can dismiss Reverend Wright as a crank or a demagogue, just as some have dismissed Geraldine Ferraro, in the aftermath of her recent statements, as harboring some deep-seated bias.\n\nBarack Obama: (14:19)\nBut race is an issue that I believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now. We would be making the same mistake that Reverend Wright made in his offending sermons about America. To simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality. The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we\u2019ve never really worked through. A part of our union that we have not yet made perfect. And if we walk away now, if we simply retreat into our respective corners, we will never be able to come together and solve challenges like health care or education or the need to find good jobs for every American.\n\nBarack Obama: (15:32)\nUnderstanding this reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point. As William Faulkner once wrote, \u201cThe past isn\u2019t dead and buried. In fact, it isn\u2019t even past.\u201d We do not need to recite here the history of racial injustice in this country. But we do need to remind ourselves that so many of the disparities that exist between the African-American community and the larger American community today can be traced directly to inequalities passed on from an earlier generation that suffered under the brutal legacy of slavery and Jim Crow. Segregated schools were and are inferior schools. We still haven\u2019t fixed them, 50 years after Brown verses Board of Education. And the inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today\u2019s black and white students.\n\nBarack Obama: (16:42)\nLegalized discrimination, where blacks were prevented often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions or the police force or the fire department, meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations. That history helps explain the wealth and income gap between blacks and whites, and the concentrated pockets of poverty that persist in so many of today\u2019s urban and rural communities.\n\nBarack Obama: (17:20)\nA lack of economic opportunity among black men, and the shame and frustration that came from not being able to provide for one\u2019s family contributed to the erosion of black families. A problem that welfare policies for many years may have worsened. And the lack of basic services in so many urban black neighborhoods. Parks for kids to play in, police walking the beat, regular garbage pickup, building code enforcement. All helped create a cycle of violence, blight and neglect that continues to haunt us. This is the reality in which Reverend Wright and other African-Americans of his generation grew up. They came of age in the late \u201950s and early \u201960s, a time when segregation was still the law of the land and opportunity was systematically constricted. What\u2019s remarkable is not how many failed in the face of discrimination, but how many men and women overcame the odds, how many were able to make a way out of no way, for those like me who would come after them.\n\nBarack Obama: (18:29)\nBut for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the American Dream, there were many who didn\u2019t make it. Those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations. Those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons, without hope or prospects for the future. Even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race and racism continue to define their worldview in fundamental ways. For the men and women of Reverend Wright\u2019s generation, the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years. That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop or the beauty shop or around the kitchen table. At times that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician\u2019s own failings. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews.\n\nBarack Obama: (19:52)\nThe fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright\u2019s sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour of American life occurs on Sunday morning. That anger is not always productive, indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems. It keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity within the African-American community in our condition. It prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real, it is powerful. And to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races.\n\nBarack Obama: (20:54)\nIn fact, a similar anger exists within segments of the white community. Most working and middle-class white Americans don\u2019t feel that they have been particularly privileged by their race. Their experience is the immigrant experience, as far as they\u2019re concerned, no one handed them anything, they\u2019ve built it from scratch. They\u2019ve worked hard all their lives, many times only to see their jobs shipped overseas or their pensions dumped after a lifetime of labor. They are anxious about their futures, and they feel their dreams slipping away. And in an era of stagnant wages and global competition, opportunity comes to be seen as a zero sum game, in which your dreams come at my expense. So when they are told to bus their children to a school across town, when they hear an African-American is getting an advantage in landing a good job or a spot in a good college because of an injustice that they themselves never committed, when they\u2019re told that their fears about crime in urban neighborhoods are somehow prejudiced, resentment builds over time.\n\nBarack Obama: (22:04)\nLike the anger within the black community, these resentments aren\u2019t always expressed in polite company, but they have helped shape the political landscape for at least a generation. Anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the Reagan Coalition. Politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. Talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism.\n\nBarack Obama: (22:55)\nAnd just as black anger often proved counterproductive, so have these white resentments distracted attention from the real culprits of the middle class squeeze. A corporate culture rife with inside dealing, questionable accounting practices and short-term greed. A Washington dominated by lobbyists and special interests. Economic policies that favor the few over the many. And yet, to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns, this too widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding. This is where we are right now. It\u2019s a racial stalemate we\u2019ve been stuck in for years. And contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, I have never been so na\u00efve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy, particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own.\n\nBarack Obama: (24:13)\nBut I have asserted a firm conviction, a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American people that working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds, and that in fact we have no choice. We have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union. For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of American life. But it also means binding our particular grievances for better health care and better schools and better jobs, to the larger aspirations of all Americans. The white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man who has been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family.\n\nBarack Obama: (25:12)\nAnd it means taking full responsibility for our own lives, by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, and reading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism. They must always believe that they can write their own destiny. Ironically, this quintessentially American, and yes, conservative notion of self-help, found frequent expression in Reverend Wright\u2019s sermons. But what my former pastor too often failed to understand is that embarking on a program of self-help also requires a belief that society can change.\n\nBarack Obama: (26:11)\nThe profound mistake of Reverend Wright\u2019s sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society, it\u2019s that he spoke as if our society was static, as if no progress had been made. As if this country, a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black, Latino, Asian, rich, poor, young and old, is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past. What we know, what we have seen, is that America can change, that is the true genius of this nation. What we have already achieved gives us hope, the audacity to hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.\n\nBarack Obama: (27:17)\nIn the white community, the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people. That the legacy of discrimination and current incidents of discrimination were less overt than in the past, that this things are real and must be addressed, not just with words, but with deeds. By investing in our schools and our communities. By enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system. By providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations. It requires all Americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams. That investing in the health, welfare and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of America prosper.\n\nBarack Obama: (28:27)\nIn the end then, what is called for is nothing more and nothing less than what all the world\u2019s great religions demand, that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. Let us be our brother\u2019s keeper, scripture tells us. Let us be our sister\u2019s keeper. Let us find that common stake we all have in one another, and let our politics reflect that spirit as well. For we have a choice in this country. We can accept a politics that breeds division and conflict and cynicism. We can tackle race only as spectacle as we did in the O.J. trial or in the wake of tragedy as we did in the aftermath of Katrina or as fodder for the Nightly News. We can play Reverend Wright\u2019s sermons on every channel, every day and talk about them from now until the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or not the American people think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his most offensive words.\n\nBarack Obama: (29:36)\nWe can pounce on some gaffe by a Hillary supporter as evidence that she\u2019s playing the race card, or we can speculate on whether white men will all flock to John McCain in the general election regardless of his policies. We can do that. But if we do, I can tell you that in the next election, we\u2019ll be talking about some other distraction. And then another one, and then another one and nothing will change. That is one option. Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, \u201cNot this time.\u201d This time, we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and Asian children and Hispanic children and Native American children. This time, we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can\u2019t learn, that those kids who don\u2019t look like us are somebody else\u2019s problem.\n\nBarack Obama: (30:54)\nThe children of America are not those kids, they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st century economy. Not this time. This time we want to talk about how the lines in the emergency room are filled with whites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care, who don\u2019t have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we do it together. This time, we want to talk about the shuttered mills that once provided a decent life for men and women of every race, and the homes for sale that once belonged to Americans from every religion, every region, every walk of life. This time, we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn\u2019t look like you might take your job, it\u2019s that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit.\n\nBarack Obama: (31:54)\nThis time, we want to talk about the men and women of every color and creed who serve together and fight together and bleed together under the same proud flag. We want to talk about how to bring them home from a war that should have never been authorized and should have never been waged. And we want to talk about how we\u2019ll show our patriotism by caring for them and their families, and giving them the benefits that they have earned. I would not be running for President if I didn\u2019t believe with all my heart that this is what the vast majority of Americans want for this country. This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. And today, whenever I find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope is the next generation. The young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election.\n\nBarack Obama: (33:27)\nThere is one story in particular that I\u2019d like to leave you with today, a story I told when I had the great honor of speaking on Dr. King\u2019s birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, in Atlanta. There is a young, 23-year-old woman, a white woman named Ashley Baia who organized for our campaign in Florence, South Carolina. She had been working to organize a mostly African-American community since the beginning of this campaign. And one day she was at a roundtable discussion where everyone went around telling their story and why they were there. And Ashley said that when she was 9 years old, her mother got cancer and because she had to miss days of work, she was let go and lost her health care. They had to file for bankruptcy, and that\u2019s when Ashley decided that she had to do something to help her mom.\n\nBarack Obama: (34:27)\nShe knew that food was one of their most expensive costs, and so Ashley convinced her mother that what she really liked and really wanted to eat more than anything else was mustard and relish sandwiches because that was the cheapest way to eat. That\u2019s the mind of a 9-year-old. She did this for a year until her mom got better. And so Ashley told everyone at the roundtable that the reason she had joined our campaign was so that she could help the millions of other children in the country who want and need to help their parents, too. Now, Ashley might have made a different choice. Perhaps somebody told her along the way that the source of her mother\u2019s problems were blacks who were on welfare and too lazy to work, or Hispanics who were coming into the country illegally. But she didn\u2019t. She sought out allies in her fight against injustice.\n\nBarack Obama: (35:30)\nAnyway, Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they\u2019re supporting the campaign. They all have different stories and different reasons many bring up a specific issue. And finally they come to this elderly black man who\u2019s been sitting there quietly the entire time. And Ashley asks him why he\u2019s there. And he does not bring up a specific issue. He does not say health care or the economy. He does not say education or the war. He does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama. He simply says to everyone in the room, \u201cI am here because of Ashley. I\u2019m here because of Ashley.\u201d\n\nBarack Obama: (36:20)\nAnd by itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not enough. It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the jobless, or education to our children. But it is where we start, it is where our union grows stronger. And as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the 221 years since a band of patriots signed that document right here in Philadelphia, that is where the perfection begins. Thank you very much everyone. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
